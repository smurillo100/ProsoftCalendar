# ProsoftCalendar
This is a JS exercise requested by Prosoft

Eventhough this was created as a Visual Studio solution file, it is only being used as an IDE. The application is completely client side, and it uses a combination of Javascript, jQuery, and Handlebars to render the calendars in the way that it was requested by Prosoft. The application can be accessed through the index.html file.

## Requirements that could not be implemented
I didn't have the time to implement the holidays rendering.
The country code is not being used at all.

## Additional notes
If I had more time I could use jQuery to get a list of holidays, render an additional .holiday class on the appropriate cells, and style it as requested.
Also, had I had more time from the start I could have looked for a calendar widget and researched if I could tweak it to fit the requirements. Since it was readonly, and given the time frame, I decided to just create my own templates.
